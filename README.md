# Disaster_Coordination
This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) implemented using Java and PostgreSQL as part of my Master's Semester 1 coursework. It demonstrates the integration of Java with PostgreSQL to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a relational database.

The project provides a user interface (Swing-based) for interacting with the database, and showcases essential concepts of database management, including executing SQL queries, handling user inputs, and displaying results.
